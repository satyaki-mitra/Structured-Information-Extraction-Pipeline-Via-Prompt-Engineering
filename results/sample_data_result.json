        "description": "CA toh ban gayeüë©üèª‚Äçüéì, \ncelebrate bhi kar liaüçæ \nper ab kyaü§î??\n\n\nAs a CA myself, I can relate to the feeling that life was simpler during our studies. We had clear goals to work towards and deadlines to meet, which provided a sense of structure and direction.\n\nHowever, once we've completed the CA course or maybe any other course for that matter, we're faced with a new challenge - navigating our career paths.\n\nAfter becoming a CA, the world is your oyster, and there are numerous paths you can choose to embark on. Here are a few options to consider:\n\n1. Join a reputed firm: Many newly qualified CAs begin their careers by joining established accounting firms. These firms offer exposure to a wide range of clients and industries, allowing you to gain valuable experience and enhance your skills.\n\n2. Pursue specialization: If you have a specific area of interest within accounting, such as taxation, insolvency, or statutory audit, you can choose to specialize in that field. Acquiring additional certifications or qualifications in your chosen area will not only deepen your knowledge but also make you a sought-after professional in your niche.\n\n3. Start your own practice: If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, starting your own accounting practice can be a fulfilling option. It allows you to be your own boss, take on diverse clients, and build your brand.\n\n4. Explore industry roles: CAs are not limited to working in accounting firms. Many industries value their financial expertise and hire them for various roles such as financial analysts, internal auditors, or financial controllers. This provides an opportunity to work closely with management teams and contribute to the strategic decision-making process.\n\n5. Consider further education: Continuing education is essential to stay ahead in the rapidly changing business landscape. You may choose to pursue advanced degrees such as an MBA or a specialized finance qualification. This can open doors to senior management positions and broader career prospects.\n\n6. Give back to the profession: As a qualified Chartered Accountant, you can contribute to the profession by getting involved in professional bodies, participating in mentorship programs, or even becoming a faculty member at a recognized institution. Sharing your knowledge and experience not only benefits aspiring accountants but also allows you to leave a lasting impact on the profession.\n\nRemember, the path you choose after becoming a CA is unique to your goals, interests, and aspirations. It's essential to stay adaptable, continuously learn, and embrace new challenges along the way. The journey doesn't end with qualification; it's just the beginning of a lifelong commitment to professional growth and excellence!\n\n\nhashtag\n#ca \nhashtag\n#charteredaccountants \nhashtag\n#caaspirants \nhashtag\n#cainter \nhashtag\n#caintermediate \nhashtag\n#cafinal \nhashtag\n#caresults \nhashtag\n#success \nhashtag\n#future \nhashtag\n#work \nhashtag\n#growth \nhashtag\n#career \nhashtag\n#careerguidance \nhashtag\n#careercounseling \nhashtag\n#careeradvice \nhashtag\n#careergoals \nhashtag\n#careerdevelopment \nhashtag\n#experience \nhashtag\n#opportunity\n‚Ä¶see more",

        "description": "\"I want to do something splendid... something heroic or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I .. mean to astonish you all someday.\" \nJo March, Little Women Louisa May Alcott\n\nThat is a bold claim. And one that I think we can all can achieve.\n\nIn fact, I have devoted an entire section to this in my new book: TOLD (The Training and Engagement Guidebook for in-house Legal and Compliance professionals).\n \nExtract below:\n\nWe are proud of our achievements. So many lawyers and compliance professionals I have worked with and interviewed share, with pride, that ‚Äòdeal‚Äô or 'that' time they implemented that program from scratch ‚Äì with a team of just three, or put together a workshop on a moment‚Äôs notice and brought the house down.\n\nBut when we don‚Äôt just reflect on the past but focus on our work having a lasting impact for our audience now and in the future, that‚Äôs when we turn our work into a mission.\n\nAnd my greatest success in doing this has not been due to just my hard work, knowledge, experience, or even creativity. \n\nIt's actually something far more practical. \n\nIt's down to the characters in the stories that bring to life the learning moments. \n\nThere was Jane. This avatar was lovingly created with my good friend and colleague, Jason Meyer. We brought her into the board room as a slightly naive, ready to impress, experienced financial controller who was taking on her first board position.\n\nWhen we first meet Jane, we see her packing up her office with a leaving card beside her. We then see her sitting at her home desk with a cup of steaming black coffee reading her board papers whilst children (we assume these are her grandchildren) are laughing and playing in the garden outside. We hear the sound of laughter and classical music.\n\nJane's setting was intentional. We imagine her to be a grandma, someone well respected in her old workplace and an intellect who listens to classical music whilst she works. We can imagine her humming. \n\nThat scene design was Jason‚Äôs genius. He made Jane human because we needed people to relate to her. The audience needed to empathise with her and go on her journey to learn the small but important differences between what is required of a senior executive compared to a board member. \n\nIt worked. Jane was part of a five part series and we were asked to produce another a year later. Jane became immortal.\n\nJane was imagined from the type of audience we were aiming at. Someone new to the board, ambitious and learning. She was our avatar.\n\nAn avatar is the starting point of making our work outlast us.\n\nYou don't need to be a script writer or artist to design your own 'Jane'. \nYou have the experience to know, understand and relate first-hand to your audience. \n\nSo, why not create a character your audience will relate to and use it in your next presentation or training session? If you do your job well, they may even see themselves in it. \n\nAnd it you want help with the design - just DM me.\n‚Ä¶see more",

        "description": "Like anything in life your base level of ability you can bank on is what you practice 10000 times.\n\nThe goal in repeating whatever it is (could be calculus, play guitar, serving tennis balls , writing code, following up with customers) is we bring our lowest performance up. Michael Phelps' lowest.performance was in the medals. His peak performances were world records.\n\nPeak performance comes from 8-12 weeks of sharpening after years of elevating the base level that we can bank on \n\nFurther to this we can only control our performance not the performance of others. who else shows up we cannot control. We can only control ourselves.\n\nI was talking to one of my angel investors Michael Fedele and saying the role of a startup CEO is to raise the lowest level of performance of our teams this is the performance we can take to bank every one of 365 days. Gradually we need to lift it so the team is a playoff contender and playing for championships.\n\nLater I was talking to my VP of Finance Muhammad Zaheed, MBA . He was beating himself up because he felt he did not bring his A game to work one day. I said, 'It is impossible to bring peak performance to the line daily, what we need from the entire team is you give today's A game even though today you have factors that don't allow you to bring your absolute peak...I don't need your absolute best daily, I need today's best'.\n\nSo last summer I was in 'peak condition' trying to qualify for the The IRONMAN Group 70.3 world's in 2024 in New Zealand in my 55-59 age group. In a hard battle over 113km I lost the final slot to a superior athlete in the last kilometer. I was empty and lost by 80 seconds.\n\nBut you can't control who shows up. I did my best that day in July 2023 and it was insufficient.\n\nBack to the drawing board to see if I can qualify but one more year means being a soon to be a 59 year old in what is actually a very competitive group of 55-59 athletes from around the world.\n\nI booked my longest vacation since starting BluWave-ai and had plans to be in peak shape for another shot at Ironman70.3 St. George Utah. But this is all a side show that allows me to practice principles of self improvement that I can in turn apply to the revenue generating part of life at work. Company goals take a primary place and then I got horribly sick in my final 8 week 'peak sharpening phase'. So I went in with my base.\n\nIt turns out some faster guys in my age group had already qualified at other races and I was in position to snatch good luck after 5:34 of racing in the heat and hills of Utah. \n\nWhen I coached soccer I used to tell the team that what matters is what you do when the coach is not looking. \n\nI never take lunch...I pack some sandwiches and train every day at lunch... and from 8-10pm when there are less obligations I end up training in the basement or gym...would be easy to skip it and go to bed. And with that I start my 40th year in triathlon, Year one was age 19, in 1985\n‚Ä¶see more",

I step into this role as the first Latina immigrant holding such a big responsibility and am grateful to have served this community locally as part of the Florida Chapter before and during challenging lockdown times, and most recently as VP of Finance.\nI firmly believe that our community's strength lies in its leadership and diversity, reflected in the dedication of our staff, several generations of outstanding members, and our devoted returning and new board members. Felice Axelrod will assume the role of Vice President. We are welcoming five incoming members: Sierra Van Ryck deGroot, Laura Doyle, Jane Glassman, Amy Oppio, and Lavita McMath Turner.\nDorothy D√°vila has been appointed Chair of Finance. Delphine Daniels was appointed Chair of Development, Kat Griefen will continue to chair the Membership and Inclusivity Committee, and Laura Bardier will maintain her position as Chair of Governance. You can find out more about all of our current board members by clicking on their photos on our website here.\nI encourage each and every one of you to actively embrace the position you hold as part of this community. Those of you starting your careers are the inspiration of our Fellowship Program, a program open to emerging professionals from cultural, racial, ethnic, and/or socio-economic backgrounds underrepresented in our field.\nFor those of you who have strengthened your career paths and ask yourselves what else can be done, I invite you to find inspiration in our Pay Equity and Career Development Initiatives; your involvement and collaboration are key for the continuity of valuable exchanges of ideas. In this day and age, gender-based wage gaps impact poverty in retirement and especially impact those with children. At ArtTable, we address this through building strong networks of opportunity within and beyond our industry, and through research and advocacy. Our next public discussion about the findings of the ArtTable Survey on Working in the Arts in October will continue to advance pay equity research for arts professionals, artists, and arts workers of all types. I look forward to supporting environments that allow our community to relieve itself from gender-generated distress.\n...\nI look forward to seeing all of you participating in our programs, mentoring, and adopting professional camaraderie and support as a life initiative; remember sharing a spot at the table will make a big difference. Finally, I want to thank all the individuals, foundations, corporations, and agencies that support ArtTable and help carry our initiatives to a successful landing.\nThank you for your support,\nNuria Richards,\nBoard President\n‚Ä¶see more",

She is a testament of the power of determination, resilience and the unwavering support of a company that truly values its employee‚Äôs growth and well-being.\n\nCongratulations on 25 years, Kulwinder!\n\n‚ÄúWhen I immigrated to Canada 27 years ago, my goal was to continue pursuing a career in law. However, upon arrival, I realized that becoming a lawyer in Canada would require an additional four years of study, which I couldn‚Äôt afford as a newcomer. As the years went by, I became a busy Mom and sought a part-time job that would allow me to be with my kids. I approached a Pizza Hut and was hired to assist during lunch buffets, thus starting my journey with the brand. I continued in this role for several years, prioritizing my family over career advancement. As my children grew and entered full-time schooling, I decided to refocus on my career. I accepted a Shift Manager position and eventually worked my way up to Assistant Manager. With determination and hard work, I was promoted to Restaurant General Manager, then District Manager, and eventually rose to the position of Regional Manager and Director of Operations for Pizza Hut and now Taco Bell.‚Äù\n‚Ä¶see more",

Marc Hustvedt is still President too!\n\nEvery LinkedIn profile tells a story.\n\nI don‚Äôt know MrBeast‚Äôs new President Jeffrey Housenbold - so let's do a LinkedIn Profile Unboxing and see what we can learn. \n\nStarting with the experience section.\n\nHe‚Äôs been busy, with 55 positions listed. \n\nIf you toss the first 5 - which includes a McDonalds internship - there are only 3 operating roles in last 50.\n\nHe spent four years running marketing and BD at eBay - and left in 2005 to take the CEO job at Shutterfly. Over 11 years, he took it public and drove substantial growth.\n\nAfter leaving in 2016 he spent five years ias a founding partner at Mega-VC Softbank and joining the board of 20+ companies. \n\nAfter a brief 11-month stint as Leaf CEO ‚Äì where he tried and failed to take the gutter protection company public, he started his own venture firm, racking up more investments and board seats.\n\nAnd in May he became President and Chief Operating Officer of MrBeast ‚Äì or as he says in his announcement post ‚ÄúMr Beast Industries‚Äù.\n\nAside, did they bury the story by announcing right after MrBeast passed T-series as the most subscribed YouTube channel?\n\nHe‚Äôs also listed as Co-Owner of ‚ÄúKirk‚Äôs Steakburgers‚Äù in Palo Alto, CA, but I can‚Äôt see him running the kitchen. Likely just the money guy.\n\nThe recommendation section shows he approved 15 recommendations from former staffers but wrote just one ‚Äì 10 years ago.\n\nHe also lists himself as author of ‚ÄúThe Shutterfly Guide to Great Digital Photos,‚Äù but I assume it was mostly written by his co-author Dave Johnson.\n\nAnd he follows 8 newsletters on LinkedIn including Gina Bianchini‚Äôs ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù, but the others are mostly investment related. \n\nInterestingly he's subscribed to ‚ÄùCannabis Index‚Äù, which should go over well if he moves to North Carolina. \n\nHint, Jeffrey, subscribe to ‚ÄúInside the Creator Economy‚Äù. But leave the weed at home.\n\nWhat can we learn? \n\nüîªHe‚Äôs a Silicon Valley insider who‚Äôs seen success and failure (typical), raised billions, and taken a startup to IPO. \n\nüîªNo media or creator investing/operating experience, aside from a board stint at Chegg and Digital Chocolate.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nüîªThere‚Äôs not a great history of non-media execs taking over creator-type companies (see Whitman, Meg and Quibi). But there‚Äôs always a first time. \n\nüîªIs this a signal that could lead to a trend?\n\nüîªMrBeast execs are typically forced to move to North Carolina. If so, will a ‚ÄúKirk‚Äôs BBQ‚Äù open soon in New Bern.\n\nüîª‚ÄúMrBeast Industries‚Äù is a heady vision. \n\nThe real question is how will this SV tech-bro mesh with a company mostly run by Mr. Beast, his brother and his mom.\n\nüëá What do you think about Mr. Beast‚Äôs new President and COO? Mold-breaker or culture clash?\n\nOh, and perhaps take a look at the story YOUR LI profile tells - before it gets unboxed too.\n‚Ä¶see more",

When this happens, people no longer have to shoulder the burden of wondering what success looks like. They no longer have to compare their experience to a peer with a different manager.

        "description": "The best way to counter bad artificial intelligence is using good AI\nBy Andrew Makridis - C4ISRNET\n\nCould terrorists or other bad actors use artificial intelligence to create a deadly pandemic? Scientists at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted an experiment to find out last year.\nResearchers asked a group of students, none of whom had specialized training in the life sciences, to use AI tools, such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT-4, to develop a plan for how to start a pandemic. In just an hour, participants learned how to procure and synthesize deadly pathogens like smallpox in ways that evade existing biosecurity systems.\nAI cannot yet manufacture a national security crisis. As Jason Matheny at Rand reiterates, while biological know-how is becoming more widely accessible through AI, it‚Äôs not currently at a level that would substitute for a lack of biological research training. But as biotechnology becomes both more advanced -- think of Google DeepMind‚Äôs AlphaFold, which uses AI to predict how molecular structures will interact -- policymakers are understandably worried that it‚Äôll be increasingly easy to create a bioweapon. So they‚Äôre starting to take action to regulate the emerging AI industry.\nTheir efforts are well-intentioned. But it‚Äôs critical that policymakers avoid focusing too narrowly on catastrophic risk and inadvertently hamstring the creation of positive AI tools that we need to tackle future crises. We should aim to strike a balance.\nAI tools have enormous positive potential. For instance, AI technologies like AlphaFold and RFdiffusion have already made large strides in designing novel proteins that could be used for medical purposes. The same sort of technologies can also be used for evil, of course.\nIn a study published last year in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence, researchers demonstrated how the AI MegaSyn could generate 40,000 potential bioweapon chemicals in just six hours. Researchers asked the AI to identify molecules that are similar to VX, a highly lethal nerve agent. In some cases, MegaSyn devised compounds that were even more toxic.\nIt‚Äôs possible that bad actors could one day use such tools to engineer new pathogens far more contagious and deadly than any occurring in nature. Once a potential bioweapon is identified -- maybe with the help of AI -- a malicious actor could order a custom strand of DNA from a commercial provider, who would manufacture synthetic DNA in a lab and return it via mail. As experts at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University has posited, perhaps that strand of genetic material ‚Äúcodes for a toxin or a gene that makes a pathogen more dangerous.\nIt‚Äôs even possible that a terrorist could evade detection by ordering ... ‚§µ ‚§µ ‚§µ\n\n- Andrew Makridis is the former Chief Operating Officer of the CIA, the number-three position at the agency. Prior to his retirement from the CIA in 2022, he spent nearly four decades working in national security.\n‚Ä¶see more",

        "description": "In her letter written to Edmund Burke in 1790 to respond to Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France , Marry Wollstonecraft, a women's rights advocate put \"Every thing looks like a means, nothing like an end, and now let us sit down and enjoy the present moment; our faculties and wishes are proportioned to the present scene\". \n\nTaken out of context, these words conjure up the notion of carpe diem. Yet, she is quite the opposite by making a century long educational plan for women at the time to be considered as an intrinsic being, rather than a mere property. The reason why she suggests the above excerpt is because she intends to calm down Burke's fear of an emulation of the French Revolution in England echoing the English Jacobins' concerns, not that she cares much for, though. Why did I quote it then? Soon, will you find out. Better still, it will make sense more in the future. \n\nFast forward to 2024, I met incredible people at Cabinet Office (CO) for the past six months. First of all, the level of humility and sense of humour is such that one day you could be sitting at a desk next to a deputy director, the other day a Chief Operating Officer who visits offices around the country. Most importantly, they'd strike a conversation in a manner with you like a normal employee and unless you know them, you will never know what their grade is. As you know in Britain, we long gave up addressing people of higher grades/positions with such archaic terms like 'Sir/Madam' unless they were knighted. Everybody from top to bottom is called with their first name, even in emails, irrespective of who they are. \n\nThe second commendable culture that CO fosters is that the wide range of support and guidance offered for individuals' learning and self- development, again regardless of what grade you are at. Hence, if you are considering working in civil service but you also value self-development in your career, look no further. \n\nAnd finally, a second to none team culture, or should I say a family-like team culture. In addition to the work-related help and support, the teams' social meets, which are usually cognitive, (once a month or so) are part of the package too. After all, if you do not enhance/retain the team's bonding, your workplace would be a tedious and hostile place culminating in unchecked arrogance between seniors and juniors. \n\nMy lovely team organised a surprise leaving party for me as seen in the picture with some exquisite presents to which I am indebted. You can see the sense of humour there. Although I will cherish the moments I spent working alongside my team, I will now sit down and enjoy my faculties and wishes being proportioned to the present time. Because, for me, everything is a means, not an end. \n\nWith that in mind, I look forward to starting my new role at MoJ on Monday which will be an invaluable experience for me.\n‚Ä¶see more",

In this post, I'll outline the key steps to establish a robust technology team, including the required roles, number of resources, experience levels, chronology order, and the overall time it takes to build the team.\n\n1. Define Your Goals and Objectives:\n Clearly articulate your business goals and technology requirements. Identify the specific areas where a technology team is essential for achieving those goals.\n\n2. Start with Core Roles:\n Begin by hiring core team members who will lay the foundation for your technology initiatives. This typically includes roles like a CTO (Chief Technology Officer), software engineers, and a project manager.\n\n3. Expand the Team as Needed:\n As your business grows, gradually expand the team to include specialists in areas such as UI/UX design, data analytics, quality assurance, and infrastructure management. Assess your needs based on your business requirements and market trends.\n\n4. Determine Resource Allocation:\n Determine the number of resources needed for each role based on the scale and complexity of your projects. Consider factors like project workload, timelines, and the level of expertise required.\n\n5. Seek Experience and Expertise:\n Balance the experience levels within your team. A mix of seasoned professionals and talented individuals early in their careers can bring a fresh perspective and drive innovation while ensuring a strong foundation of knowledge.\n\n6. Establish Chronology Order:\n Consider the logical progression of roles within your technology team. For example, start with hiring a CTO to provide strategic guidance, followed by software engineers to build the core product, and then expand into specialized areas like data analytics or UI/UX design.\n\n7. Time to Build:\n The time required to build a technology team varies based on your specific needs and available resources. On average, it may take several months to assemble a fully functional team, considering the recruitment process, onboarding, and integration.\n\nRemember, building a technology team is not just about filling positions. It's about finding the right individuals who align with your vision, possess the necessary skills, and can collaborate effectively to achieve your business goals.\n\nBy following these steps and carefully structuring your technology team, you can lay a solid foundation for success and ensure your business remains agile, innovative, and competitive in the ever-evolving digital landscape.\n\n\nhashtag\n#technologyteambuilding \nhashtag\n#startupsuccess \nhashtag\n#digitaltransformation \nhashtag\n#techroles \nhashtag\n#teamstructure\n‚Ä¶see more",

Expect a new wave of women stepping into leadership roles as coaches and administrators. At this year's event, just 12 out of 32 teams had a woman coach.\n\nThese changes will be further solidified at the Paris Olympics this summer. For the first time, the Summer Olympics will feature a 50/50 split of male and female athletes. \n\nUp next: We'll see more women serving as Olympic coaches. Women have accounted for a mere 10% of coaches over the past 10 years, according to International Olympic Committee member Nawal El Moutawakel. \"We need women and young girls to see female coaches, to believe that they too can achieve positions of responsibility and influence,\" she says. ‚Äì Cathy Anderson\"\n‚Ä¶see more",

        "description": "Ruminations from the first 3 weeks of a new VP of Marketing.\n\nTL:DR: Prioritization.\n\nIt's now been about 3 weeks in the role and I've certainly learned a lot, I'll spill some of the thoughts that really stick out to me.\n\nFair warning, dear reader, the variations of the word \"prioritize\" will make a lot of appearances in this post.\n\n1. Get yourself organized. I thought I could organize my thoughts, plans, and tasks previously, but I've had to overhaul everything. I keep a 30/60/90 in monday.com, I have a weekly task list in GSheets with To Dos, Follow-Ups, Unscheduled Asks, and Weekly Accomplishments (I can make that a template if someone wants it).\n\n2. Meet everyone you can, and keep a little black book (*doesn't have to be black, I guess). I try to schedule very informal meet & greets with all the teams with no agenda, give and get a little personal background, share my initial thoughts, and get their \"big asks\" from marketing. We're all over the country here, so I also note where everyone's located.\n\n3. The things you thought you would prioritize before starting will immediately change, and that's ok. Be flexible to the landscape and adjust accordingly. I assumed my first hire would be Content, but I quickly pivoted to a Product Marketing Manager (heads up: I'm \nhashtag\n#hiring, will drop the link in the comments). \n\n4. Listen to calls, and listen to team breakdowns of calls. You'll learn a lot very quickly, both of what prospects are asking and how your sales team is pitching. You can't align if you don't understand their process.\n\n5. Lean on your network. If you have mentor-like people, run ideas by them. I've even run \"how do I position this new role properly\" by them. You're not alone out there, even when you're a Lonely Marketer (h/t JK Sparks newsletter). \n\n6. Be strict about your prioritization. You can't do everything, even if it all seems necessary. Delegate what you can (if you have the team) and don't be afraid to push things back to get foundations in place. Don't build your department on a foundation of \"I'm trying to get everything done immediately.\"\n\n7. It is a-ok to say \"no\". Moving up from Manager to Director to VP, this shift may have been the hardest. You can, should, and need to say no to people. There are only so many hours in the day, and only so much bandwidth you and your team have. Not all asks are a priority. \n\n8. The LinkedIn community is great and I have probably 100 saved posts here. This seems very important: Not all advice, frameworks, or \"best practices\" apply to you, your company, or your industry. You need to know your situation and know when those practices won't work.\n\n9. Be excited and have fun. Ship something interesting early. Keep the excitement going, you're gonna do great! \n\nAnyway, more to come! \n\n\nhashtag\n#marketing \nhashtag\n#learning\n‚Ä¶see more",
